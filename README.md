# css-styling
A repo for experimenting with css, html, and javascript.
Built a form - tried styling with css.
Form will allow me to simulate users submitting data.
Next stage is to add the data to an object.
Then use javascript to create an array, make a for loop,
and use that for loop to iterate through the array,
populating it with the objects, containing the user data.

At this stage the css is complete but open to revision.
If anybody can suggest better methods, or explain why certain stuff works,
please do so. I will be starting the javascript soon and if anyone
would like to use or submit anything, please feel free.
